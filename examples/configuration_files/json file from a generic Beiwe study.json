Beiwe may ask you to fill out short surveys or to record your voice. It may collect information about your location (using phone GPS) and how much you move (using phone accelerometer). \r\n\r\nAlthough Beiwe collects large amounts of data, the data is encrypted to protect your privacy. This means that it does not know your name, your phone number, or anything else that could identify you. Beiwe only knows you by an identification number. Because Beiwe does not know who you are, it cannot communicate with your clinician if you are ill or in danger. \r\n\r\nBeiwe was conceived and designed by Dr. JP Onnela at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Development of the Beiwe smartphone application and data analysis software is funded by NIH grant 1DP2MH103909-01 to Dr. Onnela. The smartphone application was built by Rocket Farm Studios in Boston, Massachusetts.
